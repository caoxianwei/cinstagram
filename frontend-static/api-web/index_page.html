        <p>
          Cinstagram is a fully fledged Instagram clone. The support for
          IOS and Android will come in the future. Remember, this is just a
          educational clone and Instagram is a registered trademark of Instagram
          Inc. All of the static assets have been created by me and not copied
          from the Instagram Inc. I am just cloning the functionality of the site
          to improve my understanding of how large web applications work under
          the hood.
