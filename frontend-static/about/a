  I (Demir Antay) am not cloning this project "Cinstagram" for any kind
  of commercial or profit-wise intentions. My motive is purely educational.
   I have always wanted to test my web development skills by writing
  a big application.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have not used any of the assets of Instagram Inc. on this project.
  All of the logos ... etc. have been created by me using various tools
  such as Photoshop ... etc.
  <br />
  <br />
  I have purposefully did not put a MIT License on this project because
  even though I believe in Open Source I wanted to be safe in the legal
  terms. I hope no one will use this code for plagiarism.
