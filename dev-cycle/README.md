# `Discuss`

- There is not much to discuss, I will literally try to clone every aspect of reddit and it's features.

# `Design Features`

- Main design principles:
  - Do the easy thing first, than spend your time in the details
  - The complexity should not come from the code itself, it should come from so many apps talking to each other, there fore creating a a complex API network
  - Python where we should, and c++ where we must

- After completing each feature: test it and document it before completing it.

# `Planning`

- [x] Basic Programmer Panel (key verification)

- [x]  Basic Configuration

- [ ]  Basic URL Pathing system

- [ ]  Basic Signup system

- [ ]  basic login sys

- [ ]  basic user settings

- [ ]  basic subreddit page

- [ ] basic post page and profile

- [ ] basic home page

- [ ]  secure all of the above (password hashing, key verification, form tokens csrf ... etc.)

- [ ] Improve configuration (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ]  improve url pathing system (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ] improve signup sys fully (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ] improve the login sys fully (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ] improve help center fully

- [ ]  finish the footer's section on the right navbar mostly static

- [ ]  Do all of the user profile logic

- [ ]  Do all of the post creation logic

- [ ] Finish all user-messages logic

- [ ]  Finish all user-chat logic

- [ ] Finish all of the subreddit logic

- [ ] Finish all of the user-mod-subreddit logic

- [ ]  Finish all top growing communities logic

- [ ]  Finish all Home page logic

- [ ] Finish all of the navbar logic

- [ ] finish  all of the search logic

- [ ] improve the search algorithm and the hot, top ... etc. (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ] improve admin panel (there is nothing to improve since I didnt build anything but you get the idea finish a admin panel product fully) fully add the features above (seperate it to its own module)

- [ ] improve programmer panel fully (seperate it to its own module) (viewing the site data with graphs ... etc.)

- [ ] secure all of the features above

- [ ] Add bots to every single crud app that you have within the site
  For example create a bot that updates the blog of the site in every week, a bot to createa an announcment on the official reddits subreddit in every 10 days, and finally create user bots ...etc

- [ ] now the fun stuff begins once you think you cloned most of
  of the feautres you will create bots and try to create millions of request traffic
  over the course of month. Try to scale your site ... etc. hard and complex part begins here

- [ ] Learn about deployment etc.
