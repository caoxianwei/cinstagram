# `Discuss`

- There is not much to discuss, I will literally try to clone every aspect of reddit and it's features.

# `Design Features`

- Main design principles:
  - Do the easy thing first, than spend your time in the details
  - The complexity should not come from the code itself, it should come from so many apps talking to each other, there fore creating a a complex API network
  - Python where we should, and c++ where we must

- After completing each feature: test it and document it before completing it.
